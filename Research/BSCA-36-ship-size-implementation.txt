While attempting to make the ship size larger, I came into a large issue with the majority of the code being hardcoded in.

I spoke to Dr. Lehr during office hours and he instructed me to attempt to make them smaller instead. This was a much more achievable task, and I was able to complete such with the BSCA-36 branch.

Anything to make the ships interchangably bigger or smaller would require a complete re-work to the code.
