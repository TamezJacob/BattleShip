For researching GUI, I wanted to ensure there wasn't any wasted time, and because of this I went through all the code to gather swing elements used in this particular program. My goal was to try and get an idea of what the programmer did and how I could iterate features while not destroying what is currently working. I also read back up on different swing methods to try and find what would be the best case for our program. I believe through my research I am much more capable of coding additional GUI to the program.
