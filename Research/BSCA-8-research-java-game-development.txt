For feature/BSCA-8-research-java-game-development

This research ended up being more for java layouts and different GUI aspects


Researched java layouts and layout classes including JComboBox which I implemented in the project.

public class JComboBox<E>
extends JComponent
implements ItemSelectable, ListDataListener, ActionListener, Accessible
A component that combines a button or editable field and a drop-down list. The user can select a value from the drop-down list, which appears at the user's request. If you make the combo box editable, then the combo box includes an editable field into which the user can type a value.


Researched JColorChooser for use in changing the color of the game board
Use the JColorChooser class to enable users to choose from a palette of colors. A color chooser is a component that you can place anywhere within your program GUI. The JColorChooser API also makes it easy to bring up a dialog (modal or not) that contains a color chooser.


Researched between JPanel and JFrame because I thought about refactoring our existing code from JFrame to JPanel

Basically, a JFrame represents a framed window and a JPanel represents some area in which controls (e.g., buttons, checkboxes, and textfields) and visuals (e.g., figures, pictures, and even text) can appear. Windows can contain/display multiple panels, although in the simplest GUIs, we will associate just one panel with a window.
