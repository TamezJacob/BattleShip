## Description
- Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?

	Adrian Pena, Bryce Harmon, Curtis Kelso, Jacob Tamez, Alex Hlavka
	
- What you’re creating?

	A classic battleship game, where two people can play against each other.
		
- Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?

	Our audience is our professor, our class, and anyone else who may be interested in this game/project.
	
- Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?

	We are doing this because all of our team members seemed interested in creating a game and battleship
	seemed like a good starting point. We are hoping to gain some experience out of this project for ourselves
	and learn how to work well with others on a team.
